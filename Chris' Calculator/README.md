## Chris' Simple Calculator
Thi is a project for developing a simple calculator, that runs on the terminal. Project constituents are as follows.
1. main.c - the main C file where program execution begins (and ends :wink:)
2. main.h - the header file of all function protocols used here
3. C user-defined helper functions
    *	add.c - function for adding two numbers
    *	subtract.c - subtracts two numbers
    *	mul.c -  multplies two numbers together
    *	div.c - divides two numbers
    *   info-display.c - displays startup information about calculator
    *   program-control.c - as the name says, it offers user defined functions that help control program execution 
4. libcalc.a - library for all helper function C files used (and subsequently their object files too)
5. csc.exe - the **Chris' Simple Calculator** itself :tada: :boom: (_Feel free to download & try it for yourself_ :bangbang:)

**NOTE!** _Code is bad for your health. :coffee: :man_technologist: :woman_technologist:_
