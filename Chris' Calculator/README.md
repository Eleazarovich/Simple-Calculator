3. C user-defined helper functions
    *	add.c - function for adding two numbers
    *	subtract.c - subtracts two numbers
    *	mul.c -  multplies two numbers together
    *	div.c - divides two numbers
    *   info-display.c - displays startup information about calculator
    *   program-control.c - as the name says, it offers user defined functions that help control program execution 
4. libcalc.a - library for all helper function C files used (and subsequently their object files)
5. csc.exe - the **Chris' Simple Calculator** itself :tada: :boom:
